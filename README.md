## Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

MongoDB Atlas Account (or a local MongoDB instance)

Git

## Backend Setup
### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Artemis6161/resume-builder.git
cd resume-builder/Backend # Navigate into the backend directory

### Install dependencies:

npm install

### Create a .env file in the Backend directory and add the following environment variables:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING # Get this from MongoDB Atlas
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY # Or HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY if using Hugging Face
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Or your deployed frontend URL

* MONGO_URI: Get this from your MongoDB Atlas cluster. Remember to whitelist your current IP address (or 0.0.0.0/0 for development) in Network Access.

* JWT_SECRET: Generate a strong, random string.

* OPENAI_API_KEY / HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY: Obtain API keys from OpenAI or Hugging Face for AI suggestions.

* FRONTEND_URL: Set this to the URL where your frontend will be running (e.g., http://localhost:5173 for local development, or your Render frontend URL for deployed backend).

### Start the backend server:

npm start

The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000 (or your specified PORT).

## Frontend Setup
### Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../Frontend/resume-builder # From the Backend directory, or adjust path

### Install dependencies:

npm install

### Create a .env file in the Frontend/resume-builder directory and add the following environment variable:

VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Or your deployed backend URL

VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL: Set this to the URL where your backend is running (e.g., http://localhost:5000 for local development, or your Render backend URL for deployed frontend).

### Start the frontend development server:

npm run dev

The frontend application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173.

## Usage
1. Register/Login: Access the application through your browser and create a new account or log in if you already have one.
